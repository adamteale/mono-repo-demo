# @cms-types/contentful

## Description

Defines content-types and response types used by `Contentful` CMS:

- content-types

These are defined as normal `interfaces` attached to Contentful CMS.
This package has to be an exact mirror of the content modeling we have declared in `Contentful`.

If we change content modeling, we probably have to also reflect that change in this package.

## Running the package

```bash
# watch mode
$ pnpm run dev

# build
$ pnpm build
```
